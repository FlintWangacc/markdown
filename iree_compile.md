# IREE COMPILE
## executable
target platform executable seems generated by `MaterializeInterfacesPass` after stream dialect.

## stream dialect
stream dialect seems to consider execution stream. Some stream run on virtual machine. Some stream run on device.

## current debug
```bash
third_party/llvm-project/mlir/lib/Pass/Pass.cpp:549
third_party/llvm-project/mlir/lib/IR/MLIRContext.cpp:598
```
## Pass
### TensorPadToTensorInsertSlicePass
