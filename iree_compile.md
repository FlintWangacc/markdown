# IREE COMPILE
## executable
target platform executable seems generated by `MaterializeInterfacesPass` after stream dialect.

## stream dialect
stream dialect seems to consider execution stream. Some stream run on virtual machine. Some stream run on device.

## current debug
```bash
third_party/llvm-project/mlir/lib/Pass/Pass.cpp:549
third_party/llvm-project/mlir/lib/IR/MLIRContext.cpp:598
```
## Pass
### TensorPadToTensorInsertSlicePass
```bash
Full path: /home/hmsjwzb/work/pytorch/iree/compiler/src/iree/compiler/DispatchCreation/TensorPadToTensorInsertSlice.cpp

```
#### CanonicalizePass

## Tricks
### How to disable multi-thread in mlir

   this call and making it a no-op!
